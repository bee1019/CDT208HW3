I wanted to stick with my bubbles from Assignment 2 but change it up a little bit. 
I also randomized the background for some variance. By clicking the mouse, you can place bubbles on the screen. 
By clicking 's' or 'S' you can screen shot and by clicking backspace or delete, you can reset your canvas.
